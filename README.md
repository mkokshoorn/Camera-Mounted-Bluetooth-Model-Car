# Camera Mounted Bluetooth Model Car

Embedded systems six-person project (known as "Wacky Racers") to design and implement a camera mounted, bluetooth controlled, model car. The project had a requirement that three separate 4-layer boards were developed each with their own microcontroller and communicating over a common I2C bus. An STM32F4 microcontroller was selected for the project.
