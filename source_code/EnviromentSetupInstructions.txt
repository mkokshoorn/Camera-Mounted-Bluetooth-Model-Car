1) Download Attolic Embedded Workbench (This is used for programming/debugging via the SWD link)
	http://www.atollic.com/index.php/download/truestudio-for-arm 

	- Open Appropriate Workspace I have set up.

		- Comms
		- Camera
		- Motor 
		- Dev Board


Programming Hardware setup:

	- Grab a Dev board and some female to female cords (got heaps)
	- Find the SWD header 6 pin header (Calling the end with the dot 1):

		from Dev board to Wacky Racers boards:
		- Pin 1/??? 	to ??? (Dev Board:GND)    ------- N/A
		- Pin 2/T_JTCK 	to SWCLK (Dev Board:PA14)
		- Pin 3/GND	to DGND (Dev Board:GND)
		- Pin 4/T_JTMS  to SWDIO (Dev Board:PA13)
		- Pin 5/T_NRST 	to NRST (Dev Board:NRST)
		- Pin 6/T_SWO 	to GND (Dev Board:PB3)    ------- N/A

 


2) Download and Install Tera Term (This is used for uart communication with the chip)
	- Go New Connection -> Serial Connection -> USB Serial Port (COMX)
	- Setup -> Serial Port Baud Rate -> 115200 .
	- Setup -> Terminal -> Make syre recieve and transmit are 'CR' under new-line and encavble local echo.

	To Enable Serial Comms with MCU enter the following in the terminal (By \n I mean enter) 'm\n','3\n','9\n','1\n','1\n','2\n' then '(2)'

	Ensure the following hardware Hardware- Connection (DEV BOARD) to Bus Pirate 
		- MISO (bus Pirate) to PA2 (Usart2 Tx) (SCL)
		- MOSI (bus pirate) to PA3 (Usart2 Rx)
		- GND to GND


3)	Some Notes about Common Code:

	- I have developed some code for printing to the terminal via the dev board and will
	  port this out 64 pin controller when we begin programming. (Thurday Week 4).

	- I am working on I2C code between two dev boards and then I will port to new MCU too. (Thursday Week 4).
